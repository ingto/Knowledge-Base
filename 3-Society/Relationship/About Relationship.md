- Relationship is not a big thing, it's a million little things.
- It's a verb, a very active verb.
- We are mini culture creators, we shape and stitch(缝合) and build and mold(塑造) the micro relationship cultures that are our homes, marriages, friendships and families.
- When the zigzag(曲折) of your relationship feels like it's one big old mess. It doesn't necessarily mean you're doing anything wrong (I mean you might be), but more likely your relationship is perfectly imperfect, as it should be.
